## Project Overview

The **Number Generator** is a simple web-based application that allows users to generate a sequence of numbers based on their input. The application provides visual feedback by color-coding the numbers: red for prime numbers, green for even numbers, and yellow for odd numbers. This tool is especially useful for anyone looking to understand the basics of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and CSS styling.

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that users enter a valid number greater than zero.
- **Prime Number Detection**: Identifies and highlights prime numbers.
- **Even and Odd Number Highlighting**: Differentiates between even and odd numbers using distinct colors.
- **Dynamic Number Generation**: Generates a sequence of numbers up to the user-defined limit.
- **Responsive Layout**: Adjusts to various screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience.
